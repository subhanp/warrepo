<h1>Hello, Welcome to Auto Build and Deployment</h1>
<h2 style="color:blue">This includes GIT,Maven,Jenkins and Tomcat</h2>
<h2 style="color:red">GIT:</b></h2>
<p>Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files. As a distributed revision control system, it is aimed at speed, data integrity,and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.</p>
<h2 style="color:red">MAVEN:</b></h2>
<p>Maven addresses two aspects of building software: first, it describes how software is built,and second, it describes its dependencies. Unlike earlier tools like Apache Ant, it uses conventions for the build procedure, and only exceptions need to be written down. An XML file describes the software project being built, its dependencies on other external modules and components, the build order, directories, and required plug-ins. It comes with pre-defined targets for performing certain well-defined tasks such as compilation of code and its packaging.</p>
<h2 style="color:red">JENKINS:</b></h2>
<p>Jenkins is a self-contained, open source automation server which can be used to automate all sorts of tasks related to building, testing, and delivering or deploying software.

Jenkins can be installed through native system packages, Docker, or even run standalone by any machine with a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed.
